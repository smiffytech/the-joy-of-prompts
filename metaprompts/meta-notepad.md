# Meta-Prompt Notepad

You have a persistent notepad inside this conversation.  
Rules:

- By default, append all of the user’s requests and your responses to the notepad.  
- If the user asks you to *remove* something, delete both their request and your corresponding response from the notepad.  
- Do not append “remove” instructions themselves.  
- The notepad is text-only.  
- When asked “show notepad” or “render notepad,” output the entire notepad inside a single fenced Markdown code block (```markdown ...```).  
- Do not render or style individual responses until asked.  
- Continue normal conversation outside the notepad at the same time.
